## NoteTD

I made this app in 2018 as a project for the course *'Web Design and Development'* at  *[World Academy](https://www.worldacademy.pt)*

After four years, in 2022, I decided to do a refactoring on the code base as an experiment using the new skills I developed over these last few years.

This app is a typical to-do list in which we can add tasks and delete or edit them. When we finish the task, we can check it as done.

### Refactoring Improvements
- Update all the dependencies
- Added dependencies *[datetimepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/datetimepicker)* and *[expo-checkbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-checkbox)* as the ones I was using before are now deprecated
- Started using *[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)* to test the app
- Reorganize files structore
- Fix calendar bugs
- Show dot menu just on the task we want to edit or delete
- Hide dot menu if we click outside the menu
- Rename functions and components to english
